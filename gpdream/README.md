**GP-DREAM is a growing collection of gene network inference tools that can be transparently launched through a web interface**.
The tools include best-performing methods from the [**DREAM Network Inference Challenge**](http://dreamchallenges.org/) as well 
as other methods contributed by the community. The GP-DREAM server is powered by 
[**GenePattern**](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/). Tools can also be used as standalone command-line 
applications.
